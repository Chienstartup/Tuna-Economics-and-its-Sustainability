# Tuna-Economics-and-its-Sustainability

This is the Milestone I project assignment of MADS program done by me and my teammate Harit Achanapornkul.
I upload this project mainly to show our ability of conducting EDA and visualizing data findings.

### Motivation
Harit and I are both tuna lovers and enjoy the taste of tuna sashimi. However, we noticed more consumers are falling in love with tuna just like us in recent years, making us concerned about the tuna supply and raising questions about its sustainability. Thus, the nature of our project is to get the big picture of tuna economics and identify what factors might be correlated to the tuna caught volume and who are the major stakeholders in the tuna market, allowing us to anticipate the future of the tuna species.

### Background: 
Tuna demand is highly related to two significant markets: the canned tuna market and the sushi and sashimi market. The wild fishery solely supplies the canned tuna industry; meanwhile, the sushi and sashimi market is provided by the modern tuna aquaculture and wild fishery. However, tuna aquaculture requires wild catches of seed stock and is mainly focused on the Bluefin tuna due to its higher market price than other tuna species. Therefore, the wild fishery is still the main source of tuna supply, and the major ocean areas for wild fishery are as follows (with % of total catch):

  1)	WCPO: Western and Central Pacific Ocean (54%)
  2)	EPO: Eastern Pacific Ocean (14%)
  3)	Atlantic Ocean (10%)
  4)	Indian Ocean (22%)

We understand our proposal is a big topic that requires much effort and time, and we cannot analyze it this time due to constraints. So, we will focus on the Atlantic Ocean, the small proportion of the tuna supply, to get familiar with the tuna species and the possible factors that might impact tuna sustainability. The datasets we used will mainly be from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).

### Goal:
Our goal is to answer the following questions:

### Tuna species:
•	The changes in the number of tuna species caught throughout these years.

•	Where do different tuna species live?

•	Are there any tuna species that suffer from overfishing?

### Commercial activities:
•	What countries have caught most of the tuna?

•	What countries import and export more tuna than others?

•	How does the price of tuna fish affect overfishing?

Once compiling insights, we would like to go deeper into the tuna topics and hope one day we can present our findings to offshore fisheries and attract their attention to the sustainability of tuna because current regulations are limited on a national level and have less impact on the fishery companies. We hope the tuna fishery can be sustainable and everyone can enjoy the taste of tuna sashimi.
